## My Database / Flask project

#### My database project is based on a clothing ecommerce website.

* Github repo link : https://github.com/PatrykBal/ucd_pa_database_proj
* Render link : https://ucd-pa-database-proj.onrender.com

## Overview 

I had the whole project working a local sqlite database when tried to switch to postgresql tables loaded but would not let me create user as it said they already exist and i could not figure this out. Render is also acting up.
